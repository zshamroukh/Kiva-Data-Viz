# Kiva-Data-Viz
Codecademy SQL and Python Cumulative Project 2

This project was completed as one of the cumulative projects for the data science path on Codecademy. The file, kiva_data is originally from Kaggle and is a csv file containing over 65,000 rows of information about loans awarded to men and women of various countries by the non-profit Kiva.

I visualized and looked for insights in the dataset from Kaggle. Using Seaborn, I explored the average loan amount by country using aggregated bar charts, and visualized the distribution of loan amount by project type and gender using box plots and violin plots.
